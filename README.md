You can change the width, height, sensitivity, number of bands (peaks), and color through the "Edit variables" context menu option

When launching the skin for the first time, the spectrum width is automatically adjusted based on your computer's CPU usage

Some "lost" pixels can appear based on the spectrum width (Regardless if it is a multiple of the number of bands used for interpolation)

In this scenario, simply adjust the width until the pixels disappear
